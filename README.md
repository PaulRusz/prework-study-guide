# <PreWork Study Guide>

## Description
A study guide to assist with CodeCamp that contains important notes found throughout the modules

- The motivation behind the Study Guide was to provide a quick reference for me to refer to should I require assitance with something I know the prework went over.
- The project was built as a way to assit me with learning the ins and outs of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as how to create a proper README file.
- The project does not necessarily solve any problem, but instead provides a website for me to refer to when I require it.
- While creating this project I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functioning website.  I also learned more about utilizing Terminal and GitHub to assist with creating projects.
